1Simulations:		Contains all scripts and results of Study 1, the simulation study.
2Model_recovrey: 	Contains all scripts and results of the model recoveries of the ε-α-λ model, the ε-α model, the ε-λ model and the ε-model in 4 different adversarial environments- the human/pigeon environments with 2, 4 and 8 choice-options and the rat environments with 5 choice options. Also contains model recovery scripts for the ‘alternative memory-based mechanisms for adaptive variability’ in the folder ‘modelrevoc_7models’.
3Parameter_recovery:	Contains all scripts and results of the parameter recovery of parameters in the ε-α-λ model in 4 different adversarial environments- the human/pigeon environments with 2, 4 and 8 choice-options and the rat environments with 5 choice options.
4Data_fit:	Contains all scripts and results of the model fits. Folder ‘1eps-alpha-lambda’ contains analyses scripts and results from the main model analysis comparing the ε-α-λ model, the ε-α model, the ε-λ model and the ε-model. Folder ‘2alternative_lambda’ contains all analyses scripts and results from the ‘Alternative versions to implement the frequency-based memory’ model comparison. Folder ‘3HPC_fit7models’ contains all analyses scripts and results from the ‘Alternative memory-based mechanisms for adaptive variability’ model comparison.
5Model_validation	Contains the analysis script and results figure from the model validation.
Each of these 5 folders contains their own READ_ME file.

figure_environments.py	Script to make Figure 1 showing the structure of the stable, volatile and adversarial environments.
adversarial.png, stable.png, volatile.png	The panels of Figure 1 showing the structure of the respective environments
